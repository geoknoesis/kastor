- **Capability Detection**: Runtime detection of supported features

## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Features

1. **Check Capabilities**: Use `getCapabilities()` to see what features are available
2. **Configure**: Set up feature-specific configuration
3. **Use**: Access features through the unified API
